# Day 13: Debugging in Python

Welcome to Day 13 of the #100DaysOfPython challenge! Today’s focus was on learning and practicing essential debugging skills in Python.

## Overview
Debugging is a crucial part of the coding process, and mastering it can significantly improve both the quality and reliability of your code. Today, I explored various techniques and tools to efficiently trace and fix bugs.

## Key Learning Points:
- **Common Error Types**: Identifying syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.
- **Debugging Tools**:
  - Using `print()` statements to inspect variables and logic flow.
  - Leveraging Python’s built-in `pdb` module to set breakpoints and step through code.
- **Systematic Approach**:
  - Techniques to isolate problematic code and apply fixes iteratively.

## Why Debugging Matters
Efficient debugging not only enhances problem-solving skills but also boosts code comprehension and helps prevent future issues.

## Try it Yourself
I’ve included some examples and exercises I worked on to practice debugging. Feel free to check them out and try solving the bugs yourself!
